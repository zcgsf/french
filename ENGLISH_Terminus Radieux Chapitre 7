View raw; view wrapped

• Kronauer now descended the hill upon which stood the warehouse of contaminated refuse. He took his time. On one hand, he had no exact idea as to what he was was going to do next in the village; on the other hand, his legs were obeying him quite poorly. A long night of sleep in the prison house proved insufficient in getting him back into shape. From one moment to another, his muscles continued to remind him of the gruelling trek in the steppe, not to mention the recent arduous passage through the old forest. Naturally, his entire organism still had some difficulty in adpapting to the radionuclides that floated or vibrated throughout the village.

Walking on, he repeated to himself the strange and rash ideas of the president of "Radiant Terminus." They contorted dully within his brainpan, subconsciously, and also within the very core of the marrows of his bones. He felt them come and go within the grey areas of his body. Like a the spell of a hypnotist, he thought. They take advantage of your feebleness to numb you. They come into your interiors and leave you with no recourse.

He would have loved to sweep Solovieï far away from his thoughts. Yet, when he stepped onto the main road of the Levanidovo, he continued to brew images of a dark eternity and of a world whose own rules for existing were undecipherable. Again he heard the needle spit, again did the membrane of the phonograph tremble, docile to the sinister bends of Solovieï's voice. Kronauer, not without chagrin, noticed that he, too, submitted to this voice. It displeased him but he had listened to it almost respectully; it now inserted itself into him, lurking and prowling and, if he could not rid himself of it, it was above all because he accepted its presence. "Don't tell me that starting today you'll have him in your bones and and in your dreams. Don't tell me that, Kronauer!" he grumbled to himself. But no one responded and, continuing to walk, he remained quiet.

• He hesitated on the deserted road. He had no urge to return to his room nor to languish in the prison house and he had nothing specifically to do in the Levanidovo but, at the same time, he realized that if he did not find some sort of occupation he risked coming off as a freeloader, a godless and lawless refugee, or as a non-conformist incapable of playing part in the construction of a collective happiness. He slowed down, ganing some time by stopping before the closed door of the communist co-op, then continuing his walk as if having changed his mind. There was not a person in sight. No task revealed itself to him. He passed by the House of Pioneers and the People's Library. On his right, the house of Myriam Oumarik and Bargouzine aligned with the small building that housed Samiya Schmidt and the soviet Morgovian. He had arrived to the soviet's building and considered making an about-face when Myriam Oumarik exited her home and came to meet him. 

She pranced lightly and flexibly and, without being able to tell if she was conscious of it or not, her entire attitude was one of a seductress. She moved her body, adding a nuance of dance in her step: an invitation to a sort of animalistic, sensual, marital dance, and invitation to a physical bond. Whether she wanted it or not, she gave one the urge to get close to her and touch her. Her hair was so dark and brilliant that the sun reflected upon the top of her head and along her left cheek, creating a dazzling cascade leading to the beginnings of her chest. Her linen blouse showed no cleavage but one coud guess that her her full breasts twitched with the delicateness of each step.

Kronauer's eyes stopped upon her and, immediately——half a second later——they moved away. She moved while lit by the sun; the brightness bothered him but he maintained the appearance of not being attracted to her even if, by male atavism, he was.

He didn't want to think of her silhouette as appetizing, he didn't want to think of her like an object of desire——consumable——nor let grow within him the salacious images that accompanied the idea of appetite. 

He forbade himself from these images. On one hand because at the Orbise he had received a proletariat education that associated all sexual manifestation as immoral misbehavior. On the other hand because, like Samiya Schmidt, he had read several works by Maria Kwoll that stigmatized masculine impulses and painted them in the most odious and revolting colors. And, ultimately, because he was keeping in mind Grandma Oudgoul's warning about Myriam Oumarik's status as a married woman.
